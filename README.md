# Obsidian Project Reporter

This simple utility helps to iterate and collect information about Obsidian projects, using the Obsidian project plugin and YAML formatting, to provide a collective overview and markdown table output for use in Github pages or other markdown-publishing options.

This package has been designed to be used with automated scripting, and therefore should utilize `npx` functionality where possible. 

## Usage

```bash
npx @cms-panda/obsidian-project-reporter path-to-project-folder path-to-output-file
```
